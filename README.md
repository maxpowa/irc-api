[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxpowa/irc-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxpowa/irc-api) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/maxpowa/irc-api/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/maxpowa/irc-api?branch=master)

IRC-API is a state(ful)/(less), (a)synchronous IRC API written in Java. The API offers an (a)synchronous programming model, and has the ability to save the IRC connection state per user. SSL support has lately been added, and more features are to come soon. 

The API has been tested on various IRC networks, i.e. EFnet, DALnet, Undernet, and offers a useful and detailed interface to the Server it connects to. 

This is an open source project, and feedback is welcome from end-users as well as from developers. 

Make sure you use the latest build!
